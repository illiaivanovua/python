# python
Hi everyone. I'm student obtaining a master's degree of Corporate Finance. I started learning Python in Jan 2020, because it can be useful tool in solving financial tasks.
Here you can find my python projects. I know that I might write code not in a professional way, so I will be grateful for any help for code improvements.
